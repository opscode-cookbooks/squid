## Recipes

### default

The default recipe installs squid and sets up simple proxy caching. As of now, the options you may change are the port (`node['squid']['port']`) and the network the caching proxy is available on the subnet from `node.ipaddress` (ie. "192.168.1.0/24") but may be overridden with `node['squid']['network']`. The size of objects allowed to be stored has been bumped up to allow for caching of installation files. An optional (`node['squid']['cache_peer']`), if set, will be written verbatim to the template. On redhat based platforms, this cookbook supports customizing the max number of file descriptors that Squid may open (`node['squid']['max_file_descriptors']`). The default value is 1024.

## Usage

Include the squid recipe on the server. Other nodes may search for this node as their caching proxy and use the `node.ipaddress` and `node['squid']['port']` to point at it.

Databags are able to be used for storing host & url acls and also which hosts/nets are able to access which hosts/url

### LDAP Authentication

- Set (`node['squid']['enable_ldap']`) to true.
- Modify the ldap attributes for your environment.

  - If you use anonymous bindings, two attributes are optional, `['squid']['ldap_binddn']` and `['squid']['ldap_bindpassword']`.
  - All other attributes are required.
  - See <http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Authenticate/Ldap> for further help.

- To create the ldap acls in squid.conf, you also need the two ldap_auth databag items as shown in the LDAP Databags below.

## Example Databags

### squid_urls - yubikey item

```javascript
{
  "urls": [
    "^https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify"
  ],
  "id": "yubikey"
}
```

### squid_hosts - bastion item

```javascript
{
  "type": "src",
  "id": "bastion",
  "net": [
    "192.168.0.2/32"
  ]
}
```

### squid_acls - bastion item

```javascript
{
  "id": "bastion",
  "acl": [
    [
      "yubikey",
      "allow"
    ],
    [
      "yubikey",
      "deny",
      "!"
    ],
    [
      "all",
      "deny"
    ]
  ]
}
```

## LDAP Databags

The following two data bags are only required if you are using LDAP Authentication.

### squid_hosts - ldap_auth item

```javascript
{
  "type": "proxy_auth",
  "id": "ldap_auth",
  "net": [
    "REQUIRED"
  ]
}
```

### squid_acls - ldap_auth item

```javascript
{
  "id": "ldap_auth",
  "acl": [
    [
      "",
      "allow"
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Additional configuration files

- Set (`node['squid']['config_include_dir']`) to the directory of your additional files, ex. /etc/squid/conf.d
- It is recommended that you set `node['squid']['http_access_deny_all']` and `node['squid']['icp_access_deny_all']` to false because the include statement is at the bottom of squid.conf.  Otherwise http_access allow statements may not be evaluated in the additional configuration files.
